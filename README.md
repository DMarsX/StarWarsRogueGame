Had completed the WBA and the Design Rationale.md before the deadline but forgot to move the files in `design-docs`, so moving them now (3.52pm 1 May, 2018)

Had to alter certain parts of the designs to match the code. Some logic and referencing didn't work and was changed accordingly. (5:42pm 7 May, 2018)

Changed design again, a less complex and tedious method was implemented. (12:50pm 8 May, 2018)

Due to repeated code, a major design change must be made, force is no longer a class. The attack class will implement a force check instead (3:48pm 11 May, 2018)
