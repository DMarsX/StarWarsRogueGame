## Gameplay
### Entities
#### Blaster
A blaster is a weapon with hitpoints 100 and is represented by ```b```. 

#### Canteen
A canteen, denoted by ```c```, can be used to contain water. It can be filled at a ```Reservoir```, or any other Entity that has a ```Dip``` affordance.

#### Door
A door, represented by ```d```, is an entity with ```Enter``` and ```Exit``` affordances so that the player (controlling Luke) can enter and exit other entities (```Sandcrawler``` for example)

#### Grenade
A grenade, which is identified by ```g``` on the text based user interface, when thrown explodes violently, doing damage to both actors and other entities, in ‚Äúrings‚Äù of differing severity. It causes damages as follows:
- Entities in the location where the grenade is thrown lose 20 hitpoints.
- Entities in locations that can be reached in one step from the location where the grenade is thrown lose 10 points.
- Entities in locations that can be reached in one step from the location where the grenade is thrown lose 5 points.
- The actor that throws the grenade is not affected.

#### Lightsaber
A lightsaber, marked by ```‚Ä†``` on the interface, can be picked up by any entity, but only those entities with a lot of ```Force``` ability can wield one and use it as a weapon.

#### Reservoir
Water reserviors are denoted by ```W``` and they can be dipped into to fill fillable entities (such as ```Canteens```.  They are assumed to have infinite capacity.
